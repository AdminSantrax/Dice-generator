# Dice Generator

This project is for people who want to play tabletop RPGs or dice-based games but have lost some dice or prefer not to buy physical ones.

## Planned features

A **dice** generator should include:
- Rolling multiple dice at once.
- Buttons to add or remove dice.
- Controls to increase or decrease the value/size of the dice.
- A roll history.
- An optional “good luck” feature that gives a favorable roll after a streak of bad results.
- A dice library for specific games (e.g. Descent) with their custom dice.
